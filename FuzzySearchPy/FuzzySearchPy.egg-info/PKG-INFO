Description: # FuzzySearchPY
        
        ## What is this?
        
        A "hand written" (obviously not hand written because it's typed) port of [fuzzy-search](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fuzzy-search)
        
        ## Why was this made?
        
        I like that package and I want to use it in python
        
        ## How to use this?
        
        You create a FuzzySearcher instance
        ```
        fuzzy_searcher = FuzzySearcher(hay_stack, keys, options)
        ```
        Options is a dictionary that contains "caseSensitive" and "sort",
        They need to be booleans, both default to false.
        Keys are needed if you want to search for dictionaries.
        Hay_stack can be a list of strings of a list of dictionaries
